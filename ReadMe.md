## Collaborative filtering
In collaborative filtering, a recommendation system recommends a user products based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes. For instance, if you are listening to music on Spotify, then it is likely that the music liked by the other users with similar tastes will be suggested to you.

## Content-based filtering
A content-based recommendation engine recommends relevant content to the users based on their preferred features of other content. For instance, if a user searches for ‘yellow dresses’ frequently on an e-commerce website, a content-based recommendation engine will suggest to the user other dresses of the same color.

* A recommendation engine with both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering is called a hybrid recommendation engine.
